    <p>Prototype portable windows gaming device with full x86 support, HID controls via arduino, and touchscreen support.
          Preceding the Steamdeck and most GPD devices.  Limited gaming performance due to hardware limitations.  This was
        completed as a part of Highschool Junior year's independent studies.  The plastic shell was crafted using Google Sketchup
     and 3D printed.  Buttons were drawn with Adobe Illustrator and fabricated with a laser cutter.  HID was implemented with 
    arduino.  Most importantly, the system runs off x86 architecure, allowing the full Windows experience and ability to execute light 
    3D applications.  Portability was ensured via an array of 18650 battery cells.</p>
